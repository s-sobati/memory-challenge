# SPREAD Memory

### Background
This is a demo memory game product for a customer project, which was created by a colleague that has left the company.
The product comes without a backend and works with a custom api-client that mocks the requests. Unfortunately, he
could not finish the demo, and has left it in a non-compiling state without git history. 

#### Task
Please bring the game into a functional state (ignore ui and style to stay in the timebox),
and lay the foundation for the product that will emerge from this demo.
You may use any library you want, but please stay in a time window of maximum 4 hours.


### The Game Rules
- All the cards should be faced down when the game starts. 
- An image is revealed, when the user clicks on a card. 
- The user can reveal 2 images at a time.
- If the revealed images are the same they should stay revealed.


### Technical AC
- The code needs to be type-safe up to the i/o-boundary.
- Tests are not required
